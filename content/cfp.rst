==================================================================================
4th Workshop on Statistical Parsing of Morphologically Rich Languages (SPMRL'2013)
==================================================================================
ENDORSED BY SIGPARSE


Co-located with EMNLP 2013, October 18 - 21 in Seattle, Washington

SPMRL 2013 will feature a shared task on parsing morphologically rich languages.

Join the Shared Task mailing list : https://sympa.inria.fr/sympa/info/mrlp-sharedtask


Outline
-------

The SPMRL series of workshop provides a forum for research in parsing morphologically-rich languages, with the goal of identifying cross-cutting issues in the annotation and parsing methodology for such languages, which typically have more flexible word order and/or higher word-form variation than English.

What we have learned
--------------------

Past SPMRL installments have been host to successful identification of some problem areas and approaches that address these problems: in the presence of word order variation, more meaningful results can be reached through treebank transformations (Versley & Rehbein 2009; Tsarfaty & Sima'an 2010, Choi et al., 2012) or latent annotations (Petrov et al., 2006), the parallel use of constituency and dependency structures (Le Roux et al., 2012), as well as techniques to provide prior knowledge in the handling of unseen words (Candito & Seddah 2010, Rehbein 2011, Sigogne et al 2011; Anguiano & Candito 2012).


SPMRL has also been host to discussions on realistic and appropriate evaluation methods that can be applied in the face of morphological and/or segmentation ambiguities; these discussions have culminated in a shared task for parsing these morphologically-rich languages, which will be co-located with the workshop.

Areas of interest
-----------------

The areas of interest of the fourth SPMRL workshop include, but are not limited to, the following list of topics:

- applying cutting-edge parsing techniques to new languages
- strengths and weaknesses of current parsing techniques when applied to morphologically-rich languages
- insights and techniques that are targeted at improving parsing quality for morphologically-rich languages
- using insights from parsing and associated processing problems to motivate decisions in the creation of new syntactically annotated corpora
- annotation and parsing of data from domains and genres that are not yet covered for many languages
