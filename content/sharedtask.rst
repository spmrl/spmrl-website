The fourth SPMRL workshop will also host the first shared task on parsing morphologically rich languages.

The primary goal of the shared task on parsing morphologically rich languages is to bring forward work on parsing morphologically ambiguous input in both dependency and constituency parsing, and to show the state of the art for MRLs. In the longer term,  we aim to provide streamlined data sets and  evaluation metrics, thus improving the comparability of cross-linguistic work on parsing MRLs. The shared task will feature
tracks in constituency parsing and in dependency parsing, in gold as well as in realistic scenarios (the realistic scenario will have no gold
tokenization, no gold part-of-speech tags and morphological features).

The participants will be provided with data from 9 different languages (Arabic, Basque, French, German, Hebrew, Hungarian, Korean, Polish,Swedish). The data will be available in Penn Treebank bracketing format, CoNLL-X format and optionally in TiGerXML.
In order to ease cross-linguistic comparisons, the data set will also be released within a common size setting (ie, treebanks of 5000 sentences).

Participating groups are expected to submit a short paper (up to 6 pages - incl. refs -) describing their system which will be published as part of the SPMRL 2013 Shared Task Proceedings.

The SPMRL 2013 Shared Task will be followed by a  special issue, either in a journal or a published volume, which will include  extended versions of  papers presenting the best systems.
