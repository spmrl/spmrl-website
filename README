0) The simple way
If you have the link to the dropbox URL, simply tweak the
version in dropbox and watch http://staging.spmrl.org
being updated with the current version.

When everything is to your liking, someone with an installed
version of pelican needs to check the changes into github.

1) How to install pelican
install Python's pip package manager
sudo apt-get install python-pip
install pelican
sudo pip install pelican

2) How to update the site
edit the .rst files

bash update_the_website.sh

3) How to see what you're doing locally without
updating the actual website

bash develop_server.sh start

and then point your browser at localhost:8000

(any changes to content file will be detected and
the output/ directory updated on the fly).

Stop the whole thing with

bash develop_server.sh stop
